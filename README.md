This homework assignment was our most challenging one yet. Although using Bootstrap gives us huge advantages, I still found it to be challenging to fit everything on the page that I wanted to, that had the asthetic look while maintaining the minimum requirements. I often had to rely on peers and google for support. I really enjoyed this one and hope to continue on improving my skills.
