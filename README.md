# Collin-Porter-Portfolio

This assignment was difficult yet still very fun to work with. It was challenging becuase up to this point I'm still learning the ins and outs of HTML and CSS + CDN's for styling. It was fun because it get to express myself through code. I get to let people know who I am and what I like doing.
